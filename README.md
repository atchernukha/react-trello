# Trello-like board

## Used Technologies

* React/Redux, Material UI to build frontend
* Node/Express, Sequelize to backend
* Postgres database

## Result

You can check the app running clicking [here](https://react-trello-like.herokuapp.com/)

## Technical requirements:

* SPA approach for frontend
* React/Vue.js should be used
* State management on frontend (like redux, vuex)
* Node.js for backend
* Database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL)

## Functional requirements:

* The web application should have a trello-like dashboard.
* Users should have an ability to create as many lists as they want.
* Users should be able to create cards inside lists. Cards should have a title and timestamp of last edited time. It should be shown somewhere on the card and formatted like “30 minutes ago” or “2 days ago”.
* Users should be able to move cards from one list to another with drag and drop
* Users can delete cards and empty lists

## Would be a plus (not necessary)

* Have a hosted frontend/backend/side 
* Adaptive design  
* Save on change 


## Additional info:

* UI libraries can be used (material ui, vuetify, etc.)
* No animation required
* No perfect ui required
* Code should follow best practices (structure, patterns, etc)
